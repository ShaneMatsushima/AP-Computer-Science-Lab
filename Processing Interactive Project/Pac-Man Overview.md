# Pac-Man Overview
## Description
In this project, I will try my best to recreate the game Pac-Man. This project will consist of a pac-man, 4 colored ghostt,
small pellets, power-up pellets, a total score, and a start screen with music. 

## Story Board
1. Starts with play button on the screen playing the Pac-Man theme song
2. Initiates world with map, pellets, ghosts, and pacman
3. Score board shows up when game starts (sound of Pac-Man eating)
4. Game play of Pac-Man goes on until player loses 3 lives or eats all the pellets on the map
5. Game over screen has theme song playing with a leader board of all the high scores
